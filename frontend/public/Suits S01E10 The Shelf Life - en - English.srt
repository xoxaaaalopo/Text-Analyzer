1
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,440
Harvey: I just don't understand.

2
00:00:05,464 --> 00:00:07,025
Louis: There's a lot of things that you
don't understand, especially...

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,342
Everyone is wearing a black tie.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,000
And you're wearing a gray tie.

5
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:12,304
This is acceptable
at a black tie affair.

6
00:00:12,596 --> 00:00:14,073
There's nothing wrong
with the tie that I'm wearing.

7
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,182
Thank you.

8
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:16,867
- Would you like a glass?
- Yes, please.

9
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:17,934
Champagne, sir?

10
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:19,978
Is it? From the region.

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,355
In France.

12
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:24,778
Because if it's not,
it's called sparkling wine.

13
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,376
And I don't really
drink sparkling wine.

14
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,402
Forget it.

15
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:30,822
Forgive him. His parents
really wanted a girl. Never got over it.

16
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:32,258
Louis: Wait a minute, you can taste
the difference.

17
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,282
I'm not being a snob.

18
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,536
Not a snob? You sound
like frasier's brother.

19
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,287
Niles crane was
completely misunderstood.

20
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,288
Jessica: Okay, boys.

21
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,350
You don't want me to
give you a time out, now do you?

22
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:43,174
I'd be willing to stand in a corner,
if you agree to paddle his bottom.

23
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:44,312
Louis: Oh, that's hilarious.

24
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:46,896
I'm just saying, that if
they want us to donate to their charity,

25
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:48,164
they might as well step it up.

26
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:49,651
You know, make me want
to give away my money.

27
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,469
Your money? You're here representing
the firm, Louis.

28
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,180
And we've always been committed to
giving back to the community.

29
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,432
Jessica. Is that...

30
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,895
Tori, yes. And I owe her a call.

31
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,021
Excuse me.

32
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,696
Do I smell like sausage?

33
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,489
No more than usual. Why?

34
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,242
Uh, because I'm about to meet the future
Mrs. Louis litt.

35
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,243
I had pizza before I came,

36
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:18,388
and I just want to make sure I still am
not emanating any aroma.

37
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:20,205
Oh, you're emanating something.

38
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,667
It's called pheromones. And women find
it irresistible.

39
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,295
Watch.

40
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,260
Jessica: Harvey.

41
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:35,095
You remember Tori?

42
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:36,638
Of course. Nice to see you.

43
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,181
I told Jessica,

44
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:41,852
I don't really want to talk shop when
we're here to support a good cause.

45
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,937
Well, that's the beautiful
thing about a retainer.

46
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,501
We're always on call
when you need us.

47
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,940
So, how can we help?

48
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,944
It involves one of our
most trusted senior vps.

49
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,489
Something recently came to light about
his past. I'm shocked by it, really.

50
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,326
Tell us where it hurts
and we'll make it go away.

51
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,254
Oh. Oh.

52
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,257
Wait. Wait.

53
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,426
- Wait?
- Ah. Yeah. Let's just...

54
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,304
This feels like
it's moving really fast.

55
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,847
I should slow down?

56
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,265
No. I just... I mean, like...

57
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,143
I just got out of a relationship.
And...

58
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,937
- Right.
- You kind of did, too.

59
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,522
I wasn't really seeing anyone.

60
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:29,066
You know what I mean.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,568
Trevor.

62
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,863
- Yeah. Trevor.
- That's right. Trevor.

63
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,156
- Uh.
- Uh.

64
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,419
Yeah. No, you're right.
We should slow down.

65
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,972
- I should make us some tea.
- Mmm.

66
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,057
- You want some tea?
- Yeah.

67
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:45,415
Yeah, let's drink some tea.

68
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,758
What's the, uh, Harvard club?

69
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,137
Oh. It's a... it's, like, this clubhouse
for Harvard alumni.

70
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,431
Yeah, that invite is, uh...

71
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,893
It's for this networking
thing for lawyers. I got it at work.

72
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,895
Hmm. Would you go?

73
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,438
Wait, are you kidding me?

74
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,733
No. I have a hard enough time
pretending at work.

75
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:14,194
It's not like I want
to enter the lion's den.

76
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,575
Well, if you were gonna go

77
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,121
and you were going
to take a date...

78
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,455
It would be you.

79
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,917
I'd love to take you.

80
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,840
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

81
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,508
Who's moving too fast now?

82
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,636
Oh, I'll do it.
Saying all the right things.

83
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:44,265
Mmm.

84
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,523
Mike: Hey. What's the emergency?

85
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:53,137
Couldn't find
a date to the prom?

86
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,776
We're firing Stan Jacobson.

87
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,194
Who?

88
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,488
Senior vice president,
dreibach accounting.

89
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,323
- Our accounting firm?
- Yes.

90
00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:01,729
They're our firm and our client.

91
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,285
How's that possible?

92
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,163
They signed a conflict
of interest waiver.

93
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,448
Look at that. He's actually learning
how the law works.

94
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,084
Acquaint yourself with dreibach's
company charter

95
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,211
and Stan's original
employment contract.

96
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,796
- What did he do?
- He lied.

97
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:19,009
He lied? About what? Wait. Let me guess.
He cooked the books.

98
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,179
God, doesn't anyone on wall street put
in an honest day's work anymore?

99
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,973
Actually, he's got a stellar record
as a senior vp.

100
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,892
He lied on his resume.

101
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,520
Never got a cpa license, never even went
to business school.

102
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,231
He lied about where
he went to school,

103
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,524
and now he's getting fired?

104
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,736
Dreibach does the books
for half of wall street.

105
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,655
Word gets out that
a senior staff is a fraud,

106
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,341
they're going to start
bleeding clients.

107
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,910
We have to do this fast
and keep it quiet.

108
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,831
Relax. That's not
going to happen to you.

109
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,709
But I would get fired
if Jessica found out.

110
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,919
Found out what?

111
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,042
Just told me he's a virgin.

112
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,633
That doesn't
surprise me one bit.

113
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,343
All in due time, Mike.

114
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,512
You have those severance quotes?

115
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,729
See the money wanna stay
for your meal

116
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,941
get another piece of pie
for your wife

117
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,236
everybody wanna know how it feel

118
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,739
everybody wanna see
what it's like

119
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,742
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

120
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,869
me and missy is so early

121
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,746
busy, busy making money

122
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,122
all right!

123
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,919
All step back I'm 'bout to dance

124
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,839
the greenback boogie

125
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,443
Guard:
Oh. Where you headed, doll?

126
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:02,821
Jenny: Pearson hardman,
to see Mike Ross.

127
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,906
Guard: Uh. He expecting you?

128
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,284
No, I just was going to
drop this off.

129
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,769
No appointment,
I can't let you up.

130
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,288
Do I look like a terrorist?

131
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,914
Do I look like I want
to lose my job?

132
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,374
Rachel: Jenny?

133
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:17,043
- Rachel.
- Hey. You here to see Mike?

134
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
Sort of. I just... I was going to drop
this suit off for him.

135
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,132
Harvey called late last night.
Some big emergency.

136
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:23,884
And Mike ended up
staying the night.

137
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:27,387
Actually, could you help me out?
I am running so late to work.

138
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,097
- Sure.
- Oh, my god. Thank you.

139
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,808
Thanks.

140
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,933
- Okay.
- Thank you.

141
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,813
Oh! And can you tell Mike that I left
the key under the mat?

142
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,439
Absolutely.

143
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,376
- Thank you so much, Rachel.
- You're welcome.

144
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,526
You're amazing.

145
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,007
I'm up. I'm up.

146
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,010
Your girlfriend stopped by.
Dropped that off for you.

147
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,720
Girlfriend?

148
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,388
Did you guys move in
together already?

149
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,557
What? No, we... she's not my...

150
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,017
- Why do you care?
- Idon1.

151
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,436
What... what was
the big emergency last night?

152
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,854
Um... Harvey.

153
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,732
He's firing some big vp from our
accounting firm this morning.

154
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:22,359
Stan Jacobson?

155
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:24,194
Yeah. Why? You know him?

156
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,600
No, he was just checking in at reception
when I got there.

157
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,907
Oh, my god. I gotta change.

158
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,160
I will let him know
that you'll be right there?

159
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,954
- Thanks.
- Mmmhmm.

160
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,467
Mike: Performance numbers,
hr guidelines, severance quotes,

161
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,832
and Stan's in the waiting room.

162
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,071
Did you sleep here last night?

163
00:07:50,095 --> 00:07:51,495
I wouldn't exactly
call it sleeping.

164
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,483
- Where did you get that suit?
- Uh, Rachel.

165
00:07:54,516 --> 00:07:56,851
No, I mean, Jenny gave it to Rachel
downstairs.

166
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,938
She slept over last night.
Jenny did. Not Rachel.

167
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,375
Do I really need to be here
when you fire this guy?

168
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,942
You want to learn
how it's done, right?

169
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,904
I read this guy's employment records,
Harvey. He's smart, talented, loyal...

170
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,669
Aw, and you feel bad
for him. I'm shocked.

171
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,282
Where's my smoking gun?

172
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,429
The background check that confirmed Stan
lied about his credentials.

173
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,579
It never came through.

174
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,915
On it.

175
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,712
Come in. Come in.

176
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:25,189
Um, could you help me
with something?

177
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,774
I need to get this fax
for Harvey, and...

178
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:27,924
Good morning.

179
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,214
Good morning. He needs a...

180
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,138
You can tell, can't you?
I bet you everybody can.

181
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,515
Tell what?

182
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:39,436
You waxed your eyebrows?

183
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,980
I was with the most
beautiful woman last night.

184
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,150
Um, she waxed your eyebrows?

185
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,609
We did a lot of things
last night,

186
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,945
and waxing wasn't one of them,

187
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,697
if you know what I mean.

188
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,034
Oh, god. Uh. Well, that's great.
I'm here to ask...

189
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,095
Her name's charisse, and we have
so much in common.

190
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,038
And Mike, there was like this...

191
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,223
There was like this... mmm.

192
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,307
- Mmm-mmm.
- You know, like...

193
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,833
- Lmea"mmm.
- Mmm.

194
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,103
Like a chemical thing that would happen
when our bodies would touch.

195
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,188
No, I really don't want to have this
conversation with you.

196
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,964
Oh, come on.
We're both guys. Right?

197
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,400
Little locker room
talk around the office?

198
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,609
I mean, that creates
a little male bonding.

199
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,011
Yeah. That's crazy, I just heard my
name. Did you hear that?

200
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,572
Someone's calling.
I'm gonnajust...

201
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,972
One second, okay?

202
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,017
He's probably still a virgin.

203
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,143
Mr. Jacobson.

204
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,644
Hi. Mike Ross,
Harvey's associate.

205
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,930
So sorry to keep you waiting.

206
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:26,107
It's just going to be a couple more
minutes, okay? Okay, great. Thank you.

207
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,778
Yes, I hear you. Your office couldn't
find a copy.

208
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,048
Can you tell me the name
of the security firm you guys used

209
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,573
to do the background check?

210
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,994
Okay, great. Uh, nope, that's great.
I found the number myself.

211
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,204
Thank you.

212
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,915
Sally. Yes, this is Mike Ross
from Pearson hardman.

213
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,501
I'm calling regarding
a background check you guys did...

214
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,044
Uh, sure.

215
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:50,048
You could refuse to cooperate.
But then, you would be wrong.

216
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,092
Uh, Sally, hold on one minute?

217
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:56,846
Yeah. Uh, no. Stan is going
to be there in two minutes.

218
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,681
He's in the bathroom. Okay.

219
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,685
Sally, you there?

220
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,187
Let's do this. Uh...

221
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,524
I'm going to fax you the subpoena that
I'm holding in my hand right now,

222
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,193
and you can show that
to your boss and then we...

223
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,281
Great. Uh, let me send you
my fax number now.

224
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,992
Yes.

225
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:28,670
Stan.

226
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,755
Oh! Hey. We ready?

227
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,965
Yes. I'm sorry about that.

228
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,383
No worries.

229
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,218
I know you, by the way.

230
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:38,012
7-6-1 -1 -0-5-3.

231
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,141
Your employee code.

232
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,906
- See, I remember everyone that way.
- Ah.

233
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,644
Anyway, you are taking me
to see Harvey.

234
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,062
I have been dying to meet him.

235
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:48,314
- Why is that?
- His balls.

236
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,068
His autographed ones?
I'm a huge baseball fan.

237
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,278
Oh! Right. Really?

238
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,405
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, if I wasn't an accountant,

239
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,031
I would be a major league scout.

240
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,300
I can tell you anything
you want to know

241
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,094
- just by looking at somebody's numbers.
- Huh.

242
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,412
For instance, slugging percentage
versus strike-outs

243
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,681
- during spring training...
- Do you...

244
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:05,373
Do you want to walk and talk?
Maybe?

245
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,499
Ah. See, the thing is,

246
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,252
it's usually what we call
in the trade a miscorrelation.

247
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,379
Stan Jacobson...

248
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,756
Mr. Specter, it is a pleasure.

249
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,359
Stan, it's nice to meet you.
Has Mike...

250
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:18,678
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Is that them?

251
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,388
0h!

252
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,683
Jeter. Hank Aaron.

253
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:26,352
No way. Maris?

254
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,271
That's not number 61, is it?

255
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,064
No, but it was
signed by Tracy...

256
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,274
Stan: Stallard.

257
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,360
Big baseball fan.

258
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:36,654
Stan, why don't you have
a seat over here?

259
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,615
Why don't I, uh,
get us some waters?

260
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,410
Stan: Sorry. I get talking about
baseball, I cannot stop.

261
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,580
Well, I know how
valuable your time is.

262
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,165
I do do the books.

263
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,709
And speaking of which,
your assistant tells me

264
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,295
you wanted to go over something from
your last audit.

265
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,005
I could really use a water.

266
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:58,801
Stan, we're not here to go over any
accounting business.

267
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,720
You're here because
you're being let go.

268
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,431
What?

269
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,610
Harvey: It's not going to feel as
surprising when you understand why.

270
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,484
The firm looked
into your background recently.

271
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,064
They know you lied
about passing the cpa exam.

272
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,192
You were hired because of your
outstanding credentials

273
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,319
and the reality is,
they never existed.

274
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,034
I've been there for nine years.

275
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,245
My work has been nothing but...

276
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,806
I mean, why would this
even matter now?

277
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,084
You've been committing fraud your entire
career. The liability it presents...

278
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,002
No, I don't accept this.

279
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,797
Take a deep breath. Once you go over
the severance numbers,

280
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,049
you'll see that we've been
more than fair.

281
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:40,134
Fair.

282
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,221
You think this is fair?

283
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,558
We understand how difficult this must
be, Stan. How you must feel right now.

284
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:49,644
You have no idea
what I feel right now.

285
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:55,692
Harvey: So I'm clear, you're not denying
what we're presenting you with.

286
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:59,946
You mean that I lied back when
dreibach hired me?

287
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,829
But I'm not some
scam artist either.

288
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,664
I did go to college. I just...

289
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,618
Couldn't afford to graduate.

290
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,001
No one ever questioned it before

291
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,836
because I'm that good
with numbers.

292
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,425
How did they find out
all of a sudden?

293
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,427
They didn't.

294
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,473
This background check
is five years old.

295
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,019
Stan: What?
That doesn't make sense.

296
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,438
- Is this the original?
- Yeah.

297
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,941
So, Tori knew all this time.

298
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,155
This is the same thing
that happened to Paula.

299
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,156
Harvey: Who?

300
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,157
Paula.

301
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,642
Discovered some
undisclosed income.

302
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,820
The books weren't adding up.

303
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,412
She brought it to me.
The next thing I know, she is gone.

304
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,349
I asked Tori about it, then I started
getting shut out of meetings.

305
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,293
They're trying to hide something,
and they're firing me so they can.

306
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:56,794
Hey. Where are you going?

307
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,047
I'm not signing some agreement.
Are you kidding me?

308
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,340
I'm getting railroaded.

309
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,675
Should I go after him?

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,552
No. You've done enough already.

311
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:12,894
So, you let him leave?

312
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:16,147
Physically restraining someone
is not in my job description.

313
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,151
What about your associate? The one who
shared the background check.

314
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,737
That was a confidential
internal document.

315
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,102
Stan should have never seen it.

316
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,490
Why did you even have it?

317
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,909
You didn't expect us to fire him without
proof, did you?

318
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,370
Tori's right. Stan shouldn't
have seen it.

319
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,372
Harvey: Then, I'm guilty
of being thorough.

320
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,683
Hey. I still don't understand why you
haven't told us the whole truth.

321
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,459
I mean, if you knew
five years ago,

322
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,395
why did you make it sound like this is
something recent?

323
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,380
Because it only
came to my attention two days ago.

324
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:41,815
Then who ordered
the background check?

325
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,258
It's routine. You check
with human resources.

326
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,052
Is it routine for
human resources

327
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,679
to keep something from the ceo
for half a decade?

328
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,431
What are you insinuating?

329
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,643
I think what
Harvey is saying is,

330
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,229
given how quickly we tried
to accomplish this,

331
00:14:56,646 --> 00:14:58,439
some of the details
might have gotten lost.

332
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:01,692
What was also lost is that Stan never
signed the severance package,

333
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,903
which included
the confidentiality agreement.

334
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,588
Which means if he
decides to make waves,

335
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,616
the whole point of
avoiding negative publicity...

336
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,784
Harvey will track down Stan,

337
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,286
and make sure that he signs
the severance package

338
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,789
and the confidentiality
agreement today.

339
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,791
You have my word.

340
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,878
- Thank you.
- Of course.

341
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,094
- I'll be in touch.
- All right, sweetie.

342
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,560
She's lying. She knew about Stan.
She's known for a long time.

343
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:37,061
And that matters to us why?

344
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,896
Because she's
taking advantage of us.

345
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,106
We are being manipulated

346
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,984
into firing one of her employees
and told not to ask questions.

347
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,777
Well, I have questions.

348
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,904
And the answer, is 10.

349
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,199
As in $10 million per year.

350
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,578
The amount of business
dreibach generates for this firm.

351
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,456
Which means you have to finish
what you started.

352
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,167
Find Stan and get him
to sign those documents.

353
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh, and as far as I'm concerned,

354
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,963
that little associate of yours
is to blame for all of this.

355
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,173
That was an honest mistake.

356
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,843
He knowingly revealed a client's
confidential document.

357
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,970
That is not a mistake.

358
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,718
How many more chances are you going
to give that kid?

359
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,018
Oh, I didn't realize
we were keeping score.

360
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,229
But if that's the case, I still think
he's coming out ahead.

361
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,116
Whatever you're doing, stop.

362
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,677
No, you're going to
want to see this.

363
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,287
Paula o'Neil? The former dreibach
employee that Stan mentioned?

364
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,999
She filed a wrongful termination suit
that mysteriously went away.

365
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,959
Really? Let me see that.

366
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,047
Come with me.

367
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,510
Wait. Do you not think
something funny is going on?

368
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,196
You know what?
Here's what I think is going on.

369
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,281
You're sympathizing with Stan
because you think he's you.

370
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,305
That doesn't mean that...

371
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,159
You need to learn something
from what just happened.

372
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,101
Not the least of which is
how anyone,

373
00:16:59,227 --> 00:17:01,187
no matter how valuable,
can be let go.

374
00:17:01,312 --> 00:17:02,980
I can chalk up
what happened with Stan

375
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,566
to youthful exuberance,
but Jessica can't.

376
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,860
So, if you want to work here,
you better go home now,

377
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,671
- because if she sees you...
- Wait, wait. Is she going to fire me?

378
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,739
This habit of you empathizing
with every client,

379
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,324
it's not getting you anywhere.

380
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,495
You want to work in this firm?
You need to deal in facts, evidence,

381
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,163
information that can hold up.

382
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,707
That's what a real lawyer does.

383
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:40,642
Harvey: Stan.

384
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,230
Did you follow me here?

385
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,066
It doesn't take a sleuth to figure out
that your next step

386
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,442
would be to see another lawyer.

387
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,319
Vople and Williams.

388
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,115
They're a good firm.
Not the friendliest bunch.

389
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,134
If they called you, that is against
lawyer-client privilege.

390
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,952
No one's breaking
any laws, okay?

391
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,996
My assistant has a network
of other assistants

392
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,747
that tell her anything
she wants to know.

393
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:04,417
Like when someone calls
for an emergency appointment.

394
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:05,918
You forgot this when you left.

395
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,378
I said I'm not signing anything.

396
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,339
It's nothing to sign.
It's a lawsuit.

397
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:14,844
You worked for dreibach for nine years.
Oversaw 80 clients.

398
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:18,014
Filed hundreds of tax returns
and fought 27 audits.

399
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:21,100
Now, in light of your
recently discovered fraud,

400
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,311
all of that can now
be called into question.

401
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,064
Therefore, you're being sued
for nine years back pay,

402
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,192
plus any expenses incurred
to mitigate the damage you've done.

403
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:32,068
This is...

404
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:34,822
This would bankrupt me.

405
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,325
Or you can take what's
behind door number two.

406
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,163
It's aberdeen.

407
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:43,456
Who?

408
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,701
It's not a who, it's a what.

409
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:46,184
Dreibach is doing
business with them,

410
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,644
and I think that's
where the problem was.

411
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,504
You don't get it, okay?
I'm only leaving with one of these.

412
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,173
And if it's the lawsuit,

413
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,692
the first thing
your friends upstairs

414
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,885
are going to ask you for
is a big, fat retainer.

415
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,810
And when you tell them that Harvey
specter is the one that's suing you,

416
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,907
you're going to watch the color drain
from their faces.

417
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,642
Now, what would you like to do?

418
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,734
This is not cool. You leave me
in your apartment all night

419
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,211
and say you're going
to be right back.

420
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:15,088
You don't even thank me
for dropping off your suit.

421
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:16,530
I had a bad day, Jenny.

422
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:18,324
So, you couldn't call me.

423
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,076
I almost got fired, okay?

424
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,078
What happened?

425
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,330
It... it's not worth explaining.

426
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,585
Okay. I need to find evidence that our
accounting firm is up to something,

427
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,797
so, I found this woman who filed a
wrongful termination suit against them,

428
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,149
and she referred
me to her lawyer.

429
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,257
Did you call them?

430
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,718
Yeah, but they're this huge firm,
unger and Macy.

431
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,387
They wouldn't take my call.

432
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,971
Why not?

433
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:44,016
There's a confidentiality clause
in the settlement, for one.

434
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,146
So, it means that
they can't share details like that.

435
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,024
Yeah, I thought all lawyers
secretly shared that stuff.

436
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,193
You're all in
the same club, right?

437
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,155
What? That's not a dumb
thing to assume.

438
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,367
No. No, no, no. That's not dumb at all.
Because...

439
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,166
Unger and Macy have almost as many
Harvard grads as we do, which means...

440
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,519
They're going to be
at the mixer tonight.

441
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,046
And there are two things
that lawyers love to do. Drink and talk.

442
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,467
Man: Hi.

443
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,970
Uh, Mike Ross, class of 2011?

444
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:23,431
Ross. I'm sorry.
I don't have you on here.

445
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,933
Do you have your ID?
I can run it through the computer.

446
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,309
Uh, my Harvard ID?

447
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,937
What did you say
your name was again?

448
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,440
- Michael Ross, of Pearson hardman.
- Michael Ross...

449
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:37,445
Boy, you think they ask Harvey
for his ID when he comes to this place?

450
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,282
Harvey specter? You work with
Harvey specter?

451
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,161
Uh, yeah. Yes.
I'm his associate.

452
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:46,829
I can call him if you like.

453
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,165
Just don't tell him I gave you
any trouble, okay?

454
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,126
Welcome.

455
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,251
Thank you.

456
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:57,757
Mmm. Oh, god. I'm never going
to survive this.

457
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,134
Deep breaths. You'll be fine.

458
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,356
Jessica: Hey.

459
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:17,234
I saw the signed severance papers on my
desk. Thank you.

460
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,861
And I also left word for Tori.

461
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,571
Yes, we spoke. She's relieved,

462
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,282
but I wouldn't go so far as to say
completely forgiving.

463
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,201
You ever heard
of aberdeen solutions?

464
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,287
Dreibach listed them
as a consultant firm.

465
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,248
They bill us every month
for their management services.

466
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,042
- Okay...
- What does that mean?

467
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,454
Well, check with accounting.

468
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,963
I did. They can only tell me
how much we pay them.

469
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,882
So, I called aberdeen directly.

470
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,592
It's an automated
answering system.

471
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:44,345
I left six messages. No returns.

472
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,306
Stan mentioned it. Something just
doesn't feel right.

473
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,286
Are you saying you want to
investigate our client?

474
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,603
They're also our accountants.

475
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,146
And Tori is also a friend.

476
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,025
Harvey, if you
got caught and didn't...

477
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,401
I wouldn't get caught.

478
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,616
I am explicitly telling
you not to do this.

479
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,788
Oh. Then, I'll let you know what I don't
find after I don't look into it.

480
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,807
Hey, should we get the rest of the 2010
grads with us for a pic?

481
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,392
The rest? This is 2011 only.

482
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,227
Isn't he from the 2010 class?

483
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,565
Man: Hey, who is that guy?

484
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,317
No. No, I was 2011.

485
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,486
You're not with us.

486
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:44,488
Yeah, Rudy. It's Mike.

487
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,657
You know, we...
We hung out a bunch. You...

488
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:47,908
Where?

489
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,054
Oh, you know what? Maybe I'm thinking
about somebody else.

490
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,288
Sorry about that.

491
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,957
Has anyone seen
that guy here before?

492
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,122
Jenny: Will you excuse me?

493
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,588
Hey. I'm not having any luck.

494
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,148
I wish I could say different, love,

495
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:04,133
but it's been
a Potter's field for me, too.

496
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,637
What? You get to pretend to be someone
else. I wanted to try. It's fun.

497
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,139
An accent? Hmm.

498
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:14,310
Okay, I'll stop. What?

499
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,437
You're amazing.

500
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:22,109
And that's Brian Jennings.

501
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,694
Jenny: Who's Brian Jennings?

502
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,988
I saw his face on unger and Macy's
website today.

503
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,032
What are you waiting for? Go.

504
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,123
Hi.

505
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,709
10 days for public exposure.

506
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,337
Next time you need a bathroom
in Times Square,

507
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,796
go into a hotel.

508
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:46,175
Five minute recess.

509
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,015
Harvey.

510
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,642
Long time, Anthony.

511
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,768
Morrison: Huh.

512
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,520
You keep company with the high rollers
on centre street.

513
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,440
What are you doing
down in night court?

514
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,067
Need a favor.

515
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,653
What kind of favor?

516
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,988
One that requires access
to sealed court documents.

517
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,240
Can it wait till tomorrow?
I've got this backlog...

518
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,160
When you came to me two years ago in
the middle of the night,

519
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,579
did I tell you it had to wait
till tomorrow?

520
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,083
My chambers.

521
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:24,213
So... this is quite a surprise.

522
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,067
Who'd ever think that you and I would be
on a double date?

523
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,217
Excuse me?

524
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,153
Oh, come on. You had to notice
when you walked in the room.

525
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,428
She's absolutely gorgeous.

526
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,764
She's completely infatuated with your
girlfriend.

527
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,892
- Come on.

528
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,244
Come on.
I'll introduce you to her.

529
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:42,356
Charisse, honey. Uh, this is one of my
associates, Mike Ross.

530
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,066
- Oh. So nice to meet you.
- Hi.

531
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,431
And I'm in love with your date.

532
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,880
Seriously. She's just been
telling me about her work with monkeys.

533
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,905
It's fascinating.

534
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,449
- Huh.
- So, really, they're as smart as us?

535
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,575
Oh, smarter.

536
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,370
I never had a chance with him.

537
00:24:57,663 --> 00:25:00,332
I need to use the ladies' room.
Would you excuse me?

538
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,218
Monkeys aren't smarter
than humans. I'm sorry.

539
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,190
Well, it depends on which humans you're
talking about, I guess.

540
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,549
- What?
- Huh?

541
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,176
Morrison:
Name of case and rough date.

542
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,054
Aberdeen v. Paula o'Neil.
Say, six months ago.

543
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,515
Let's see.

544
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:20,227
Says here that they were listed as
a subsidiary of dreibach

545
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,062
in a wrongful termination suit.

546
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,456
That's it.
That's what I'm looking for.

547
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,190
I can't print this out.
It'll get tagged.

548
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,067
Come around and take a look.

549
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,361
Is that what you were after?

550
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,282
Yeah, that's it.
But what's that?

551
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:39,246
That links to another
court filing in relation to aberdeen.

552
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,040
Click on it.

553
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:45,294
Says here that they
filed for dissolution. Earlier today?

554
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,254
The whole company?

555
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,132
That's what it says.
They're officially shut down.

556
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,259
I'm going to need
one more favor.

557
00:25:54,762 --> 00:25:57,056
I think it's great that you found
someone not in law,

558
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,408
who works out in the real world.

559
00:25:58,432 --> 00:25:59,725
Why do you say that?

560
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,351
Because I'm stuck
in a suit all day.

561
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,228
Or an office, or a courtroom.

562
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,634
I think it would be nice to be in
nature. Don't you, Mike?

563
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,691
Well, I love that
you're a lawyer.

564
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,109
In fact,

565
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,820
I'd love to see where
you work sometimes.

566
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,823
You would?

567
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,493
I'm not feeling so well
all of a sudden.

568
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:18,744
- Yeah.

569
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:20,496
- Do you think we can go?
- Yeah.

570
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,621
- Right now.
- Now.

571
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,349
- Yeah, so great to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

572
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,653
- Have a good night.
- Yeah. Bye.

573
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:28,629
Okay. Why didn't you
do that sooner?

574
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,256
'Cause I had to get this first.

575
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,699
That's the guy, right? From the firm.
That's his employee ID.

576
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,636
He gave this to you?

577
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:36,804
No, I stole it.

578
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,430
What?

579
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,933
Listen. You can spend all night trying
to get to the guy,

580
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,685
or you could just go
into his firm yourself and look.

581
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,063
- Come on.
- Let's go.

582
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,864
Mike: Yeah, I can barely
keep my eyes open myself.

583
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,450
They got me filing briefs.
Sucks.

584
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,937
You actually came.

585
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,065
You must be Harvey specter.

586
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,651
Joe, was it?

587
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:34,963
Your friend fill you in on
the deal that's on the table?

588
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,530
Let me just get it straight.

589
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,490
You caught him
rifling through some files

590
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,055
and in lieu of calling
the police, you want me to pay you off?

591
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,954
I never said that. He did.

592
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,290
Oh, that's great. This way,

593
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,126
if I level a charge of extortion,
it's hearsay, huh?

594
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,045
Ten years working for a law firm,
you learn a thing or two.

595
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,899
Which is good, 'cause you sure as hell
don't make a lot of money doing it.

596
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,675
Somehow, I think
you're getting by fine.

597
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,011
Just say I know
the level you guys play at.

598
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:00,512
Espionage happens all the time,

599
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,765
which is why I know you'll do anything
to protect your secrets.

600
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,145
Well, actually, Joe spina of 2561 clover
Lane in astoria, queens,

601
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,521
I think we all would.

602
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,275
Like those tax returns you filed jointly
for the last six years

603
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,068
while no longer
living with your wife.

604
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,487
You know, the IRS can
destroy you for that.

605
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,383
You think you're the first person to
try to extort me, Joe?

606
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,075
Because that's
the level I play at.

607
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:25,996
Now, you're a security guard
who likes to take risks.

608
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,122
I like that.

609
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:28,665
So, here's what
we're going to do.

610
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,336
This here is a generous donation to Joey
junior's little league team.

611
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:36,006
Now, if it gets to them, it gets to
them. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

612
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,593
But the next time we talk, it's going
to be me who wants a favor.

613
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,141
Officer.

614
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,977
Mike: Do I really need
to pay you back?

615
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,188
Let's start with an explanation.

616
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,857
You said I needed to find evidence.
So, I went to find some.

617
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,734
By breaking into
another law firm?

618
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,837
Is that really worse than paying off
a security guard?

619
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,380
Okay. First of all,
I didn't pay him off.

620
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,116
Second of all, if I hadn't paid him off,
you'd be in jail right now.

621
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,202
You think I might
be right about Stan.

622
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,828
No. I never said you were wrong.

623
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:08,372
I said we needed evidence.

624
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:10,749
What? Did you find something?

625
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,461
Dreibach bought a shelf company
13 months ago.

626
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,546
What's a shelf company?

627
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,383
It's a corporation that exists
only on paper

628
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,802
so its owners can
hide their assets.

629
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,136
Isn't that a shell company?

630
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,554
No, it's a shelf company.

631
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,390
Okay. Take a shell company.

632
00:29:26,515 --> 00:29:29,226
Give it a bank account,
credit history, tax returns.

633
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,646
And let it season
for years on a shelf.

634
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,982
Someone buys it,
slots their name into it,

635
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:39,361
and they walk away with an established
corporation with a pre-existing history.

636
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,781
Anyone looks any closer, you shut it
down and do it again.

637
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:43,949
That's legal?

638
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:48,036
Shelf companies are legal. I'm guessing
what Tori's doing with hers isn't.

639
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,205
Wait a minute.
Is it called aberdeen?

640
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,251
Yeah, I saw it on the top of this list
with 37 other management companies,

641
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:57,212
all related to dreibach, in that
wrongful termination suit.

642
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,650
When we get back to the office,

643
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:04,094
I want you to find legal precedent that
will allow us to subpoena those records.

644
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,180
Okay. On it.
But do I really have to pay you back?

645
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,472
Every penny.

646
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,351
Wait a minute. How much was
in that envelope?

647
00:30:19,568 --> 00:30:21,212
Mike: Hey. What are you all
doing in my desk?

648
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,476
Dude, you gotta check this out.

649
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,243
Excuse me. Excuse me.

650
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,997
Is that Louis?

651
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:33,182
Seth: Uh-huh. In the lobby.

652
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:34,708
Mike: Is this a security camera?

653
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,227
A live feed?
What are you guys doing?

654
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,770
No, this is from last night.
The guys in security

655
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,254
emailed it up
to Louis this morning.

656
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,757
And why are we watching it
on my computer?

657
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,651
Well, we're not going to risk
watching it on one of ours.

658
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,395
And everyone knows your password.

659
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:46,970
How does everybody
know my password?

660
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,306
Ross 999?
How hard is that to crack?

661
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,517
Okay, 999...
Increases the odds, okay.

662
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:53,642
Shh. Here it comes.

663
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,479
All: Oh!

664
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,397
What?

665
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,733
All: Oh!

666
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,695
Mike: Oh, no.
What did he say to her?

667
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,824
Evidently, Louis wants a restraining
order and he needs this as evidence.

668
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,287
What? Uh... um...

669
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,955
Okay, listen.

670
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,001
Please don't...
I came in here and it... look, I...

671
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:21,880
Are you okay? Down... Louis.

672
00:31:28,095 --> 00:31:30,323
If the message you left was another
trick to get me down here...

673
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:32,099
No tricks, I assure you.
Come on in.

674
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,392
Stan, I'm Jessica Pearson.

675
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:34,976
Oh, yeah. I know who you are.

676
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:38,188
You said if I accepted the severance
agreement, there wouldn't be a lawsuit.

677
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:42,109
Well, there is one.
But not against you. With you.

678
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,238
We know about aberdeen. We know what
Tori was orchestrating.

679
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,573
And with your help,
we can expose her.

680
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,954
Why should I help you?

681
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,206
What have you got to lose?

682
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,505
Tell me what you need me to do.

683
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,636
Rachel: Hey.

684
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,432
What does he have you
trying to find this time?

685
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,142
You really want to know?

686
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,940
Uh, I managed to get a look at some
files involving our accounting firm.

687
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,025
What's up with
our accounting firm?

688
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,069
They're stealing from us.

689
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,073
You know your phone bill,
you have all those surcharges?

690
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,801
You have no idea what they mean,
but you pay them, anyway?

691
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:32,701
Yeah.

692
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,429
Yeah, well, dreibach's doing
the same thing to us,

693
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,872
except all their charges
are a complete scam.

694
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,082
Pretty sure
the phone charges are a scam, too.

695
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,876
Yeah. Maybe.

696
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,377
So, what do you need?

697
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,674
I need a legal reason to get those files
without saying I saw those files.

698
00:32:48,592 --> 00:32:51,052
You need them for court
or you just need them?

699
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,889
Why?

700
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,324
Well, you said you
read them, right?

701
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,224
Yeah.

702
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,269
So, then, you already
have them. In here.

703
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:01,813
You're right. I do.

704
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,899
Yes. So, you dictate, I'll type.

705
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,444
What? You'd actually
do that for me?

706
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,906
They're stealing from us.
Pearson hardman is my firm, too.

707
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,533
Come on.

708
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,951
Okay.

709
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:17,913
With the party of the third part

710
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,457
hereto referred to as
Norton llc rendered to...

711
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:22,959
Not the subject of any litigation
or any claim that

712
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,086
might be reasonably anticipated
to give rise...

713
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,106
Being acknowledged that such appointment
is irrevocable

714
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,810
and shall be deemed
a power coupled with...

715
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:31,301
Lawfully invested with the power to
make such contracts

716
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,969
or to perform acts

717
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,139
from which it may
be lawfully implied.

718
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,391
That's it. Did we get it?

719
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,936
Saving and... wait for it.

720
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,478
Done.

721
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,987
What?

722
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,865
Your mind. It's just...
It's amazing.

723
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,743
Thanks.

724
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,162
What?

725
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,081
Your mind's amazing, too.

726
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,292
Oh. Thank you. Thank you.

727
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,754
Who are you calling this late?

728
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,798
Oh. She's waiting up for you?

729
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,026
Yeah, I guess you're right.
It's pretty late.

730
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,290
She's probably sleeping by now.

731
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,844
- Yeah.
- I'll just text her.

732
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,764
It's tough to have a relationship
with a first year.

733
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,475
Or any year.
You just don't have a life.

734
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:22,894
How did you make it work?

735
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,731
Who said I did? It's... it's impossible
to have anything long term

736
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,276
unless you find someone that has the
same 80 hour work week.

737
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:33,572
And then, that doesn't work either,
because they're busy, too.

738
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:36,737
Yeah. Well, I'm not going to let that be
the reason that Jenny and I don't...

739
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,047
What are you two
still doing here?

740
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,799
- Uh, it's for Harvey.
- Nothing.

741
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,384
- Uh, but we're done.
- Goodnight.

742
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,343
- Yeah. I'll see you later.
- Goodnight.

743
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,886
- Bye.
- Bye.

744
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,895
I'm sure you're aware of this, but, um,
I'm just going to remind you, anyway.

745
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,857
Um, this office frowns
upon relationships in the workplace.

746
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,068
Yeah.

747
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,800
- Watch it.
- Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

748
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:38,136
It's okay.

749
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,681
Hey, uh, thank you
for last night.

750
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,975
The typing.

751
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,810
- Of course. Right.
- Yeah.

752
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,079
- Absolutely.
- It was really helpful.

753
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,188
Mmm-hmm.

754
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:52,984
Um, hold on one second. Sorry.
Hello?

755
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,986
I said I needed you
in my office.

756
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,671
- And I said I was on my way.
- Save it.

757
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,907
- Those the files?
- Yes. Take them, please.

758
00:35:59,032 --> 00:36:01,326
Stan is in my office. Meet us in
the conference room.

759
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,911
Okay.

760
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,916
Harvey:
Sorry to keep you waiting.

761
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:08,917
That's okay.

762
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:11,711
I got your email with the list of
other law firms.

763
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,881
I respect your effort to make amends
by referring new clients.

764
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,026
Harvey: Oh, that wasn't
a list for client referrals.

765
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,250
Those were firms you should consider
for representation.

766
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,970
We're no longer
your attorneys, Tori.

767
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,138
What?

768
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,366
Harvey:
We have no choice, really.

769
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,910
It would be impossible
to represent you

770
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:27,310
when we plan on suing you
for every penny you've got.

771
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,229
Is this a joke?

772
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:34,859
Aberdeen solutions. Created in June of
2006, sold to dreibach in 2010,

773
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,111
dissolved two days ago.

774
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:38,279
Before that,
it was Bolton finances.

775
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:41,783
And before that,
it was Norton services, Littleton llc...

776
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:43,678
- Where did you get those?
- We know what you did, Tori.

777
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,412
You couldn't have
subpoenaed these files.

778
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:46,746
And yet, we have them.

779
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,289
Take a look. They're all there.

780
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,290
And now, we have proof.

781
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:53,044
Proof of what? Those are all legitimate
corporations used for...

782
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,338
Stealing money and
lining your own pockets.

783
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,840
But don't take my word for it.

784
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,341
Guys?

785
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:05,974
Hello, Tori.

786
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,225
Harvey: Yeah, we hired Stan

787
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,477
to do a little
independent consulting on our behalf.

788
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,802
And he's come up with
some very interesting connections.

789
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,649
It was easy.
Even if I don't really have a degree.

790
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,153
Jessica: There was that vacation
you invited me on last year,

791
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,864
to your new house
in The Bahamas.

792
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,242
A house you bought
with money you stole from this firm.

793
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,493
My firm.

794
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:28,496
- Jessica...
- Jessica, what?

795
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,540
Tori: You can't use any of this.

796
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,751
We have
attorney-client privilege.

797
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,377
Harvey: With dreibach
accounting, yes.

798
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,463
With the shelf companies? No.

799
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,799
And unfortunately for you,
you're listed on the shelf companies.

800
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,885
You stole from me.

801
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,970
You either come clean now,

802
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,931
or the only time you'll see your
children in the next decade

803
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,058
will be during
prison visiting hours.

804
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,375
So, I'm going to get
my job back now, right?

805
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,817
I don't see why not.

806
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,068
No, Stan, you're not.

807
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,571
What?

808
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,032
Dreibach's going bankrupt
after this all shakes out.

809
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,317
Even if they don't, they're not going
to hire you back.

810
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,036
Why?

811
00:38:09,496 --> 00:38:11,331
Because you falsified
your resume.

812
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,336
What am I supposed to do now?

813
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:19,088
Harvey: Well, we just got you more
than your severance package.

814
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:23,343
I suggest you use it to tide yourself
over until you figure something out.

815
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,440
Stan.

816
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,152
Hey. Your best asset
is your mind.

817
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:43,029
They can't take that from you.

818
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,615
One little mistake.

819
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:49,410
You could go back to school,
become legitimate.

820
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,204
Start over?

821
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,044
I never should have done it.

822
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,569
I told you
they wouldn't catch me.

823
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,864
What are you looking for, Harvey?
Positive reinforcement?

824
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,533
Nothing major. A trophy. Nobel.

825
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,202
Would your likeness in bronze
in the lobby be okay?

826
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,204
Bust or life-size?

827
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,790
You did a good thing, Harvey.

828
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,501
But it wasn't just me, you know.

829
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,105
Well, then, I guess
I should give the kid

830
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,506
the benefit of the doubt
from now on.

831
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,550
You should.

832
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,651
Well, you'll be happy to know
that Stan has no idea

833
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,212
what he's going to do
with the rest of his life.

834
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,446
That doesn't make me happy.

835
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,951
What if I tell you I have no idea
what I'm doing with mine?

836
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:18,082
What the hell are we going to do when
I get caught, Harvey?

837
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,576
- You're not going to get caught.
- That's your answer?

838
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,173
What else is there?

839
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:29,886
Why?

840
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,846
What?

841
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,932
Hire me. Why would you
do that to me?

842
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,559
- You mean for you.
- No. I don't.

843
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,121
You've made it perfectly clear that you
only do things for yourself.

844
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,188
So, why?

845
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,857
You mean the reason
why I became a lawyer?

846
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,610
Or your friend dealt drugs?
Or you used to cheat?

847
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:46,879
I cheated because I need to...

848
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,947
You couldn't make money
any other way? Bullshit.

849
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,283
Life is this.

850
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,036
I like this.

851
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,413
That's not me.

852
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,457
Well, if it wasn't me,
you wouldn't be here.

853
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:02,835
So, if you want this to stop,
all you gotta do is tap out.

854
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,434
- Hello.
- Oh.

855
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,936
You're here to see Mike.

856
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:21,813
We're going to
celebrate his victory.

857
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,022
Ah.

858
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:27,568
You know, I actually think
that it's a really,

859
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,614
really good idea that you've come
to pick him up.

860
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,490
In fact, if I were you, I'd do it
a little more often.

861
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,201
Just all those late nights
working with Rachel...

862
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,079
What do you mean?

863
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:40,415
What do I... oh, come on.

864
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,125
You're a smart girl.

865
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,960
You understand animal behavior.

866
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,504
I think you can figure it out.

867
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:52,468
Hey. You ready?

868
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,761
Yeah.
